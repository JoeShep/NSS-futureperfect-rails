NSS-futureperfect-rails
=====================

Purpose
-------

This is my example project for the Unit 3 (Rails) Capstone project for Nashville Software School Software Development Fundamentals course.

This capstone project doesn't have many constraints, as it is to serve as a resume piece. It must be a Rails app and it can use any number of gems and services.

The goal of this project is to create a rotating task-list, similar to the [iOS app 30/30](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/30-30/id505863977?mt=8)
